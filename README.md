The purpose of this program is to test various node modules to learn how they operate.

Using node, the user will select one of 3 options to gather tweets, song data, or movie data. If none are provided it will default to a predetermined option found in "random.txt". If the user calls for something other than one of the three, it returns an error and tells the user what they can call.

The user can provide a search term as well. If one is not provided, a default is set.
